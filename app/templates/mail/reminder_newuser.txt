Once you're up and running, you can invite your friends to use foodloggr and add them to your friends list in foodloggr. You can see what your friends have been logging and give them encouragement to keep eating well, or perhaps tell them off for that junk food they ate!

We hope you enjoy using foodloggr, and that it helps you achieve your goals of living a healthy lifestyle.

Regards,
foodloggr
